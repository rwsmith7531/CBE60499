x is array of N by 1 vectors

B is array of N by N matrices

k = 0 # initialize iteration counter k
x[k] = x0 # store starting point x0 to iteration history of x
B[k] = identity_matrix

while B is not singular and max_iterations is not exceeded:
	f[k] = f(x[k]) # Evaluate f(x) at current iteration
	grad[k] = gradient(x[k]) # evaluate gradient
	check_nan(grad[k]) # ensure gradient isn't NaN before proceeding
	if k > 0 then:
		step = x[k] - x[k-1] # set delta_x step
		y = grad[k] - grad[k-1] # set change in gradient of f as y
